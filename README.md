### **Technical Details**

#### **1. Object-Oriented Programming**
- Classes for core entities: `Book`, `Patron`, `Reservation`, `Borrowing`, etc.
- Use of **inheritance** to represent different resource types.
- **Polymorphism** supports multiple operations like borrowing and returning books.

#### **2. Data Structures**
- **Linked Lists**: For managing dynamic book and patron records.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Handle reservations and transactions.

#### **3. Database Design**
- **Relational Database**: MySQL is used for data storage and manipulation.
- Database schema normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** for consistency and minimal redundancy.
- Core tables: `Books`, `Patrons`, `Reservations`, `Borrowing`.

#### **4. SQL Skills**
- SQL queries for:
    - Table creation and normalization.
    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    - Joins and aggregations for generating reports.
- Use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

#### **5. JDBC Utilization**
- Robust **JDBC integration** for database communication.
- Error handling and connection management.
- Secure execution of SQL queries with prepared statements.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Java** (JDK 21)
- **JavaFX** for UI design
- **MySQL** for database management
- **JDBC** for database connectivity
